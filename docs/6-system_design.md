# NEW PROJECT NAME

## Overview

This document tracks the system design features, architectural decisions, and implementation details of the ArXiv Research Pipeline. It serves as a reference for design patterns, configuration options, and system behaviors that may not be explicitly documented in the BRD or PRD.

## Document Purpose

Unlike the Business Requirements Document (BRD) and Product Requirements Document (PRD), this document focuses on:

1. Technical implementation details
2. System architecture decisions
3. Design patterns used in the codebase
4. Configuration options and their impacts
5. Data flow between system components

## Design Decisions

### Module-Based Execution

The system supports both direct script execution and module-based execution patterns:
- Module execution pattern (`python -m src.module.script`) is preferred
- This pattern properly handles package imports and dependencies
- The system is designed as a proper Python package structure

### Docker Containerization

- Each service runs in its own Docker container
- Data persistence handled via Docker volumes
- Inter-service communication via Docker network
- Configuration mounted from host to containers

### PDF Processing Flow

## Monitoring Architecture

The monitoring system follows a sidecar pattern with the following components:

1. **Prometheus**: Central metrics collection service
   - Scrapes metrics from all system components
   - Stores time-series data with retention policies
   - Configuration in `config/prometheus/prometheus.yml`

2. **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboard platform
   - Auto-provisioned dashboards in `config/grafana/dashboards/`
   - Preconfigured Prometheus datasource
   - Accessible on port 3001 to avoid conflict with Web UI

3. **Exporters**: Purpose-built metrics collectors
   - cAdvisor: Container resource usage metrics
   - Node Exporter: Host system metrics
   - MongoDB Exporter: Database performance metrics

4. **Application Metrics**: Custom instrumentation points
   - Processing time measurements
   - Success/failure rate tracking

## Future Design Considerations
- Asynchronous processing pipeline
- Event-driven architecture for better component decoupling
- Improved error handling and retry mechanisms
- Performance optimization for large-scale paper collections
- Automated alerts based on monitoring thresholds
